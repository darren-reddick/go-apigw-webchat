Afternoon!
For anyone interested I put together a little personal project as an example of how to build a websocket API using AWS Apigateway + Lambda. I had never done any work with websockets and was totally clueless about them so thought it would be a good way to get to know them. 

It uses the serverless framework to deploy the resources in AWS so its also a nice way to see how serverless can simplify the deployments.

The code is up on github public and its still a work-in-progress so i'll probably add to this over time maybe with some authentication (+make the code less ropy) etc. as its been quite enjoyable.
